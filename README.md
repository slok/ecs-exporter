## Docker

You can deploy this exporter using the [slok/ecs-exporter](https://hub.docker.com/r/slok/ecs-exporter/) Docker image.

Note: Requires AWS credentials or permission from an EC2 instance, for example you can pass the env vars using `-e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID} -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}` options

For example:

```bash
docker pull slok/ecs-exporter
docker run -d -p 9222:9222 slok/ecs-exporter -aws.region="eu-west-1"
```
